# Creating a Hearing Aid

## Socially Responsible Computing

### Overview
Our project utilizes computer graphics to design hearing aids for infants and young children. By creating a mesh of the clientâ€™s ear and a sample hearing aid based on this mesh, we aim to provide a personalized and comfortable solution for those in need.

### Objectives
- Take a pre-existing mesh of an ear and a pre-existing mesh of a hearing aid.
- Alter the mesh of the hearing aid to fit perfectly into the mesh of the ear.
- Utilize matrix multiplication for translations, as the hearing aid is a multi-object file.

### Milestones

#### Milestone 1: Create Multi-mesh Assistive Device
- Add shading for both object meshes.
- Manipulate the sizing of the hearing aid object to be proportional to the ear.
- Create a tutorial/simulation of device use with key events for user interaction and text explanations for different parts of the device.
- Implement mouse events for rotating the device.

**Outcome 1:**
- The hearing aid should fit into the ear.
- When the user clicks a button, the processor takes the electrical signals from the microphone and converts them into manipulatable digital signals.

#### Milestone 2: Enhance Multi-mesh Assistive Device
- Add texture mapping to the objects.
- Enhance the tutorial/simulation of device use by adding a non-fixed camera, allowing the user to rotate the camera around the object and zoom in.

**Outcome 2:**
- Objects now have texture.
- The user can rotate the camera around the ear to see the hearing aid from different angles.

#### Milestone 3: Ideal Add-ons
- Introduce multiple meshes of different assistive devices and tutorials.
- Allow user interaction to place/use the assistive device on a model.
- Provide an indication of success, such as "Good Job."

**Outcome 3:**
- The user can remove the hearing aid from the ear and reattach it.
- Upon successful reattachment, a confirmation message is displayed.
